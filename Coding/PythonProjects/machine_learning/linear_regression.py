"""
Linear regression is a method for fitting a straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) to given input features and their corresponding outputs,
so that we can use this fitted line to predict the output for new feature values.

# Definition

Linear regression is a supervised learning method that models the relationship between one or more independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target) 
by assuming a linear relationship between them.
