## Data types
### Strings
- We can use either use double quotation mark as: string = "My name is Arpan"
- Or we can use triple quotation mark: string = """My name is Arpan.
                                                I live in Miami."""
- Note with triple quotation mark, if we have line break then it will also appear same in the printed statement.
