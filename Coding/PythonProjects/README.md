## Data types
### Strings
- We can use either use double quotation mark as: string = "My name is Arpan"
- Or we can use triple quotation mark: string = """My name is Arpan.
                                                I live in Miami."""
- Note with triple quotation mark, if we have line break then it will also appear same in the printed statement.

#### Combining Strings
See file "strings.py"

#### String length: len() keyword can be used to print the number of characters in string
See file "strings.py"

#### Converting to string: str() can be used to convert other types to strings
See file "strings.py" 

#### f-Strings 
See file "strings.py"

### Booleans: True and False Values for decisions

#### Creating Booleans
- Direct Assignment
  - is_generated = True
- From Comparisons
  - image_size = 256
  - valid_size = image_size == 256


## Control Flow
### If statements
See file "if_else_statements.py"

### Loops
#### For Loops
- Python start index is 0. This is called “zero-indexing”
- See an example file "loops.py"

## Data Structures
### Lists
See "lists.py" for all loops' functionalities

### Dictionaries
- Store data with key-value pairs
- See dictionaries.py for detailed information on dictionaries methods and usage
