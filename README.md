# DeepLearning-Projects
This project delves into different vision tasks such as classification, segmentation, compression, and generation

## Classification
We have implemented ResNet50 and various Vision Transformers (ViTs) in a transfer learning setup.

### Compute Mean and Standard Deviation
It is recommended to compute the mean and standard deviation of the dataset before training. We have provided a Python script for this purpose. You can find it [here](compute_mean_standarddeviation.py).
